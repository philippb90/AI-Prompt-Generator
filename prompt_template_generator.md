# Moonlit Waves Labradorite Pendant - Handcrafted Silver Wire-Wrapped Necklace

Capture the mysterious beauty of moonlight dancing across ocean waves with this enchanting labradorite pendant necklace. Each stone has been carefully selected for its unique blue and green flashes that seem to shift and change as you move, just like the surface of the sea under moonlight. Lovingly hand-wrapped in sterling silver wire using traditional techniques passed down through generations of artisans, this pendant transforms natural stone into wearable art.

The substantial labradorite stone (1.5" in length) is securely embraced by intricate silver wire work, creating a one-of-a-kind piece that can never be exactly replicated. The flash phenomenon known as "labradorescence" gives this stone its magical quality, believed by many to enhance intuition and protect the wearer's aura.

This versatile pendant hangs from an 18" sterling silver chain that can be adjusted for the perfect fit, allowing you to wear it with both casual and formal attire. The sterling silver components have been given a light polish to enhance their natural luster while maintaining the authentic handcrafted aesthetic.

Each necklace arrives in a handmade fabric pouch with a care card explaining how to maintain the beauty of your labradorite and silver jewelry, making it ready for gift-giving or a special treat for yourself.

Perfect for nature lovers, those drawn to unique gemstones, or anyone who appreciates the irreplaceable value of handcrafted jewelry.
